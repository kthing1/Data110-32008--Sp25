# The wonder of art
I've always found art wonderful! Drawing has always been my comfort hobby. It's my way of expressing myself, however I do get fustrated whenever I am unable to draw something I've envisioned in my mind.
## Variations of art
There are many different canvases you can use when you draw, I was a traditional sketchbook artist until I moved onto digital art in the seventh grade.
### My Art journey
I've been drawing seriously since 6th grade. Unfortunately, I stopped drawing during high school (that's when I got addicted to online games) but picked it back up during college.
#### Inspirations and influences
It's quite easy for me to be inspired, I usually draw characters from shows I've watched! I love a good character design, sometimes I draw people I stumble across on Pinterest as well. Drawing different features is always so much fun for me.
##### "I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people" 
###### - Vincent van Gogh

**The Future of my art**

*I'm not sure where I'll end up with my drawings. I like to post them online and I do appreciate it when I see people enjoying my art but I'm not sure if I am confident enough to make it into a living.*

***Maybe that's why I'm a business analytics major rather than an art major***

# Important Things in Art
1. A canvas
2. Something to draw with
3. Yourself
4. Your mind

*You can draw whatever and however as long as you have these four!*
# Art Essentials 
* **Element of Art** - This includes line, shape, form, color, value, texture, and space
* **Principles of Design** - This includes balance, contranst, pattern and unity.
* **Art Mediums** - This includes drawing, painting, digital art, photography, etc!
  
## Speedpaints!
I absolutely adore watching speedpaints. A speedpaint is basically just watching an artist draw but sped up. I used to binge watch them back in middle school, often using it as white nose as I drew.

This is one of the most memorable speedpaints I've watched back in middle school and last year I got to meet the artist in person! They're one of my favorite artists.
